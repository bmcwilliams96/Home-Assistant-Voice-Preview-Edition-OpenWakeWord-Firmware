This requires you to take control of an already configured Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition in ESP Home Builder (Add on available in home assistant). Once you take control, click EDIT, and paste in the yaml file from this repo. Make sure you have all !secret variables mentioned in the yaml available in your esphomebuilder setup. Also, make sure "name" substitution in the yaml is set to the host name of your Voice Preview Edition (I found this hostname in my router UI)
